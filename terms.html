    <h3>Subscriptions and payment</h3>
    <h5>Free use</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>
            We may make certain Services available to you free of charge, up to certain limits as described on the Website. 
            Usage of the Services in excess of those limits requires a paid subscription. 
            We may terminate your access to the the Free Services at any time without prior notice and will have no liability in respect of such termination.
        </li>
        <li>
            As a condition of using the Free Services, you agree to include ‘MailGen’ branding and accreditation on any Content you send using the Services.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Subscription</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>
            1. If you register for a monthly subscription, this ‘Subscription’ section applies to you.
        </li>
        <li>
            2. The “Subscription Fees” are the fees payable by you for your subscription, charged to you in accordance with the levels of usage you undertaken of the Service.
            You agree to pay the Subscription Fees based on the size of your list of Subscribers in the Service, and the volume of Content sent to those Subscribers, 
            during your monthly subscription period.
        </li>
        <li>
            3. Your subscription begins as soon as your initial payment is processed. Your subscription will auto-renew 
            (that is, it will automatically roll over on expiry to a new period of the same duration) on the same day of each month until either we or you cancel the 
            subscription, in which case it will end at the end of the then-current subscription period. You can cancel your subscription at any time by emailing us 
            at contact.omega23@gmail.com. Your payment is non-refundable and your subscription will continue until the end of the current 
            billing period. We may cancel your subscription by emailing you at the email address specified in your account.
        </li>
        <li>
            4. The Subscription Fees are subject to change at any time, but you will be notified of any change by email to the address listed on your account.
            We will also post a notice of the change on the Website. 
            The change will take effect at the beginning of the following billing period.
        </li>
        <li>
            5. Subscription Fees are payable in US Dollars (USD) and are exclusive of value added tax (or other applicable sales tax), 
            which shall be added at the appropriate rate.
        </li>
        <li>
            6. At any time you may upgrade your subscription to one that provides higher allocations of Content or Subscribers in respect of the Service. 
            To upgrade contact our support team at contact.omega23@gmail.com. We shall calculate the cost of your upgraded subscription and commence a new subscription 
            in place of your existing one. If you attempt to import Subscribers or send Content in excess of your current subscription level, 
            you will be prompted to upgrade accordingly. If you accept, this will result in an upgrade in your subscription 
            level and the applicable Subscription Fees (a “Subscription Upgrade”). Any incremental additional Subscription Fees associated with a Subscription Upgrade 
            will be prorated over the remaining period of the current subscription period and payable immediately. In any future subscription period, 
            your Subscription Fees will reflect any such Subscription Upgrade unless you restore your number of Subscribers to be consistent with the subscription level 
            applicable prior to the Subscription Upgrade.
        </li>
        <li>
            7. To downgrade contact our support team at contact.omega23@gmail.com, and your usage level shall be decreased to your new subscription 
            level from the beginning of your next monthly subscription period, or you can downgrade from the Billing section in the Service. 
            No refunds or credits for Subscription Fees will be applicable if you downgrade your subscription.
        </li>
    </ol>

        authorised to use any credit card you provide details of, and that any and all charges may be billed to that credit card and won't be rejected.
